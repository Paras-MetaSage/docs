## Core Concepts

Understanding these terms will help you navigate ShiftSage:

-   **Requests**: Any formal submission for overtime initiated by a user.
-   **Rules**: Configurable logic that dictates the routing of requests (e.g., "Requests over 2 hours require Manager + HR approval").
-   **Workflows**: The automated path that requests follow through the system, from submission to final status.
-   **Statuses**: The current state of a request, such as `Pending`, `Approved`, `Rejected`, or `Escalated`.
-   **Thresholds**: Predefined limits or criteria within rules that can trigger different actions or escalation paths.
-   **Escalations**: Automatic processes that advance a request if it exceeds a defined time limit at a particular stage.
