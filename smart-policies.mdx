ShiftSage's Smart Policies are the core of its automation capabilities. They allow administrators to define and enforce complex overtime rules, approval workflows, and escalation procedures based on various criteria and thresholds.

## What are Smart Policies?

Smart Policies are configurable rule sets that automatically govern how overtime requests are processed. Key functions include:

-   **Automated Routing**: Directing requests through predefined approval chains.
-   **Threshold Management**: Applying different rules or requiring additional approvals when requests exceed certain thresholds (e.g., hours, cost).
-   **Compliance Enforcement**: Ensuring requests adhere to company policies and labor regulations.
-   **Escalation Logic**: Automatically advancing requests if they are not actioned within specified timeframes.

## Key Components of a Smart Policy

When configuring a Smart Policy, you will define several key components:

-   **Policy Scope**: Defines which employees, departments, or roles the policy applies to.
-   **Conditions & Rules**: Criteria that requests must meet for the policy to apply (e.g., type of overtime, day of the week).
-   **Approval Workflows**: The sequence of approvers or approval groups required for a request.
    -   Can be multi-level (e.g., Supervisor → Manager → Director).
    -   Can vary based on request thresholds.
-   **Thresholds**: Specific limits that trigger different behaviors within the policy.
    -   *Example Threshold*: Overtime requests exceeding 8 hours per week require an additional level of approval.
    -   *Example Threshold*: Requests submitted less than 24 hours in advance trigger a notification to HR.
-   **Escalation Rules**: Defines what happens if a request is not approved or rejected within a set timeframe at any stage of the workflow.
    -   *Example Escalation*: If a request is pending with a Manager for more than 48 hours, escalate to the Director.
-   **Notifications**: Automated alerts sent to relevant parties at different stages of the workflow or upon policy triggers.

## Creating and Managing Policies

1.  **Access Policy Management**: Navigate to **Settings → Smart Policies** in the ShiftSage admin interface.
2.  **Create New or Edit Existing**: You can create a new policy from scratch or modify an existing one.
3.  **Define Scope and Conditions**: Specify who the policy applies to and the conditions under which it is triggered.
4.  **Configure Workflow & Thresholds**: Design the approval chain(s) and set up any relevant thresholds that modify this chain or trigger alerts.
5.  **Set Up Escalations**: Define time limits for each approval step and the corresponding escalation path.
6.  **Activate Policy**: Once configured, activate the policy to apply it to new overtime requests.

## Policy Examples

-   **Standard Overtime Policy**: Requests up to 4 hours approved by direct Supervisor; 4-8 hours by Supervisor then Manager; requests over 8 hours (threshold) also require Director approval. Escalation to next level if pending for 24 hours.
-   **Weekend Work Policy**: All weekend requests require Manager approval, regardless of hours. Escalation to HR if pending for 12 hours.
-   **Emergency Overtime Policy**: Expedited approval by any available Manager, bypassing standard thresholds for urgent operational needs.

By leveraging Smart Policies, organizations can ensure consistent application of overtime rules, reduce manual intervention, improve compliance, and streamline the entire overtime management process.
