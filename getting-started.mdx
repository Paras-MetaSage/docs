This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for setting up and configuring ShiftSage for your organization. Follow these instructions to quickly get your overtime management system operational.

## 1. Account Creation & Initial Setup

Begin by setting up your organization's ShiftSage account:

-   **Sign Up**: Navigate to [app.shiftsage.com](https://app.shiftsage.com) to create your organization's primary account.
-   **Email Verification**: Check your inbox for a verification link and click it to confirm your email address.
-   **Organization Profile**: Log in and complete your organization's profile. This includes essential details such as company name, industry, and size.
-   **Invite Key Personnel**: Add initial administrators and managers who will be responsible for configuring and managing the platform.

## 2. Core Configuration

Once your account is active, configure the foundational elements of ShiftSage:

### Define Organizational Structure

-   Navigate to **Settings → Organization Structure**.
-   Create departments, sites, and teams to mirror your company's operational hierarchy. This structure is crucial for assigning policies, roles, and approval workflows.

### Set Up User Roles

-   Go to **Settings → Roles & Permissions**.
-   Define user roles such as `Administrator`, `Manager`, `Supervisor`, and `Employee`.
-   Assign specific permissions to each role, controlling access to features and data.

### Configure Overtime Policies (Smart Policies)

-   Access **Settings → Smart Policies**.
-   Create policies that define overtime rules, including:
    -   Eligibility criteria for overtime.
    -   Approval workflow paths and required approvers at each threshold.
    -   Overtime rate calculations (e.g., 1.5x, 2x).
    -   Maximum allowable overtime hours (thresholds).
    -   Conditions for automatic escalations.

### Connect Integrations (Optional)

-   Visit **Settings → Integrations**.
-   If applicable, connect ShiftSage with your existing HRIS, payroll, or time-tracking systems to ensure seamless data flow.

## 3. Employee Onboarding

With the core system configured, you can now onboard your employees:

-   **Bulk Import Users**: Use the CSV upload feature under **People → Import Employees** to add users in bulk.
-   **Send Invitations**: Trigger email invitations to all new users, prompting them to create their ShiftSage accounts.
-   **Mobile App Adoption**: Encourage employees to download the ShiftSage mobile app (iOS and Android) for convenient access to request submissions and status tracking.

## 4. Processing Your First Overtime Request

Your ShiftSage instance is now ready to manage overtime requests:

1.  An **Employee** submits an overtime request via the web or mobile application.
2.  The request is automatically evaluated against the relevant **Smart Policies**, checking for compliance with defined rules and thresholds.
3.  Designated **Approvers** are notified and can review, approve, or reject the request based on the configured workflow.
4.  Upon final approval, the overtime request is logged, and the data becomes available for payroll processing and reporting.
