---

ShiftSage provides a structured and automated workflow for managing overtime requests from submission through approval, including handling escalations. This ensures consistency, policy adherence, and timely processing.

## 1. Request Submission

The overtime process begins when an employee or their manager submits a request:

-   **Employee-Initiated**: Employees can submit requests through the ShiftSage web portal or mobile application, providing details such as date, hours, and reason.
-   **Manager-Initiated**: Managers or supervisors can submit requests on behalf of their team members, particularly for pre-planned or urgent overtime.

## 2. Policy Evaluation & Routing

Once a request is submitted, ShiftSage's Smart Policies engine evaluates it:

-   **Rule Check**: The request is checked against applicable policies based on the employee's role, department, and the nature of the request (e.g., overtime duration, requested time).
-   **Threshold Analysis**: Policies define specific thresholds (e.g., maximum hours, cost limits). If a request exceeds a threshold, it may require additional approval steps or trigger specific notifications.
-   **Workflow Assignment**: Based on the policy evaluation, the request is routed to the first designated approver in the configured multi-level approval workflow.

## 3. Approval Process

Approvers review requests assigned to them:

-   **Notification**: Approvers receive notifications (email, in-app, mobile push) for pending requests.
-   **Review & Action**: Approvers can:
    -   **Approve**: If the request is valid and compliant.
    -   **Reject**: If the request is not justified or violates policy. A reason for rejection is typically required.
    -   **Request More Information**: Send the request back to the submitter for clarification or additional details.
-   **Multi-Level Approvals**: Requests may pass through several approvers (e.g., Supervisor → Manager → Department Head) depending on the defined workflow and thresholds.

## 4. Escalations

To prevent delays, ShiftSage includes an escalation mechanism:

-   **Time-Based Escalations**: If a request remains pending with an approver beyond a configured time limit (e.g., 24 hours), it can be automatically escalated.
-   **Escalation Paths**: Escalations can route the request to:
    -   The next level in the approval hierarchy.
    -   A designated backup approver.
    -   An administrator for review.
-   **Notifications**: Relevant parties are notified when an escalation occurs.

## 5. Final Status & Logging

Once a request completes the workflow:

-   **Status Update**: The request is marked with a final status (`Approved`, `Rejected`).
-   **Audit Trail**: All actions, decisions, comments, and escalations related to the request are logged for audit and compliance purposes.
-   **Payroll & Reporting**: Approved overtime data becomes available for payroll processing and inclusion in management reports.

This structured workflow ensures that all overtime requests are handled consistently, policies are enforced, and decisions are auditable.

## Edge Handling

- Re-submissions blocked by date/employee deduplication  
- Actions while impersonating are traceable  
- Timestamp handling for end-of-month or holiday OT
