This section addresses common questions about using ShiftSage. If you don't find your answer here, please contact our support team.

## Account and Access

**Q: How do I reset my password?**

-   Use the "Forgot Password" link on the ShiftSage login page. An email will be sent with reset instructions. Check your spam folder if you don't see it.

**Q: Can I access ShiftSage on my mobile device?**

-   Yes, ShiftSage offers dedicated mobile apps for iOS and Android, allowing you to manage requests and approvals on the go.

**Q: How do I update my notification preferences?**

-   Navigate to **My Profile → Settings → Notifications**. You can customize alerts for email, in-app, and mobile push notifications.

## Overtime Requests & Approvals

**Q: Why was my overtime request automatically rejected?**

-   Requests may be auto-rejected if they violate critical Smart Policy rules, such as exceeding weekly overtime thresholds, falling within blackout periods, or lacking required information. The rejection notice will usually specify the reason.

**Q: Can I edit a submitted overtime request?**

-   You can typically edit a request if it is still in `Pending` status and has not yet been actioned by an approver. Once an approval process has started, modifications might be restricted or require resubmission.

**Q: What happens if my designated approver is unavailable (e.g., out of office)?**

-   ShiftSage can be configured with escalation rules. If an approver is unavailable, the request may be automatically routed to a backup approver or escalated to the next level in the hierarchy after a defined period.

**Q: How are overtime request thresholds managed?**

-   Thresholds (e.g., maximum hours, cost limits) are defined within Smart Policies. Requests exceeding these thresholds may trigger different approval workflows or require additional authorization.

## Smart Policies and Workflows

**Q: How often should we review our Smart Policies?**

-   We recommend reviewing policies quarterly, or whenever there are significant changes in organizational structure, labor laws, or business operations. Regular review of policy effectiveness and escalations can also highlight areas for adjustment.

**Q: Can different departments have different overtime policies and escalation paths?**

-   Yes, Smart Policies can be scoped to specific departments, roles, or sites, allowing for tailored overtime rules, approval workflows, and escalation procedures across your organization.

**Q: How do we test changes to policies before activating them?**

-   ShiftSage may include a policy testing or simulation feature that allows administrators to see the potential impact of policy changes using historical or hypothetical request data before going live.

## Reporting and Data

**Q: How can we export overtime data for payroll processing?**

-   ShiftSage provides data export functions, typically in CSV or Excel format, which can be configured to match the import requirements of your payroll system. Look for **Exports → Payroll Data**.

**Q: What is the data retention period for overtime requests and audit logs?**

-   Data retention periods are typically configurable based on your organization's compliance and archival needs. Consult your ShiftSage settings or administrator for specifics.

## Technical Support

**Q: How do I report a technical issue or get help?**

-   Contact ShiftSage support via the in-app help widget, email (e.g., support@shiftsage.com), or your dedicated support channel. Provide detailed information, including steps to reproduce and screenshots if possible.

**Q: Is there scheduled maintenance for ShiftSage?**

-   Planned maintenance is typically scheduled during off-peak hours to minimize disruption. Advance notification will be provided for any maintenance that may impact service availability.

## Integrations

**Q: Can ShiftSage integrate with our existing ERP system?**

A: Yes, ShiftSage offers pre-built integrations with major ERP systems including SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics. For custom ERP systems, our API-based integration allows for seamless data flow with minimal IT involvement.

## Cost and Implementation

**Q: How does ShiftSage reduce overtime costs?**

A: ShiftSage uses AI to analyze historical data patterns, predict future needs, and optimize shift scheduling. By identifying inefficiencies and providing actionable insights, companies typically see a 25-35% reduction in overtime costs within the first quarter of implementation.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**

A: Typical implementation takes 1-2 weeks from kickoff to full deployment. Our modular approach allows for phased rollout, starting with core tracking features and gradually adding optimization and predictive capabilities.

## Operations and Compliance

**Q: Is ShiftSage suitable for multi-location operations?**

A: Absolutely. ShiftSage is designed for enterprise-scale operations with multi-location support, role-based access control, centralized reporting, and location-specific policy configurations. The system can handle thousands of employees across multiple sites with robust permission controls.

**Q: How does ShiftSage handle union rules and compliance requirements?**

A: ShiftSage includes a configurable rules engine that can be adapted to your specific union requirements, labor laws, and company policies. The system automatically flags potential compliance issues before they become violations.
